# crossfirehitboxeditor
hitbox editor for crossfire (internal)

# reason
I was a bit lazy to play by myself skill and I increased hit area (where game thinks, you hitted players model) of player model

now I'm done

# now
You can do it on your own localization, but I willn't leak inject method - use your own hands and brains

# how
Game engine allows us to do it - it has all the calculation for the fight ON LOCAL CLIENT

All you need to hook some functions and you'll be able to do anything with this game you want

Bonus: All existed AC's (includes tournament) doesn't check game functions for being non-modified

Bonus2: If you want to do it in external way - some AC's (not my.games prob, they fixed it after my radar proof-of-concept) have a vuln (it's soooo old for Windows)

# when
Code will be released today, but a bit later
